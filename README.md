# BaseballElimination
This project is about Baseball Elimination using maximum flow computation. 
Abstract:
The Baseball Elimination Problem Solver is a program designed to analyze and solve the baseball elimination problem. The problem involves determining if a given baseball team is mathematically eliminated from contention for the playoffs based on the outcomes of the remaining games. The program takes a file as input containing the necessary information about the teams' wins, losses, remaining games, and games against each other. It employs the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, a widely-used maximum flow algorithm, to construct and solve a flow network representing the baseball division. By calculating the maximum flow in the network, the program determines if a team is eliminated and provides a certificate of elimination, i.e., a subset of teams that mathematically eliminate the given team.

The program offers various functionalities, including retrieving the number of teams, accessing team information such as wins, losses, and remaining games, and checking if a specific team is eliminated. It utilizes efficient data structures, such as maps and arrays, to store and access team-related data. The implementation adheres to object-oriented principles, promoting code modularity and reusability.

The Baseball Elimination Problem Solver provides a practical solution for baseball enthusiasts, sports analysts, and researchers to evaluate the playoff chances of teams based on their performance and remaining games. Its utilization of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm showcases the application of graph theory and network flow algorithms in solving real-world problems. The program's efficiency and accuracy make it a valuable tool for decision-making and analysis in the context of baseball tournaments and sports competitions.
